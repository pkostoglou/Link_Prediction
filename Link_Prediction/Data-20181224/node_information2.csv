1004,2000,moving mirrors and thermodynamic paradoxes,Adam D. Helfer,Phys.Rev.,quantum fields responding to moving mirrors have been predicted to give rise to thermodynamic paradoxes i show that the assumption in such work that the mirror can be treated as an external field is invalid the exotic energy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales at which the model is credible for a first-quantized point-particle mirror it appears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in the mirror's state an accurate accounting of these energies will require a model which recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity and almost certainly a model which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes that is a second-quantized model"J.

Steinhardt (Princeton), Burt A. Ovrut (Penn), ",Phys.Lett.,daniel waldram cern in this paper we show how the generic coupling of moduli to the kinetic energy of ordinary matter fields results in a cosmological mechanism that influences the evolution and stability of moduli as an example we reconsider the problem of stabilizing the dilaton in a non-perturbative potential induced by gaugino condensates a well-known difficulty is that the potential is so steep that the dilaton field tends to overrun the correct minimum and to evolve to an observationally unacceptable vacuum we show that the dilaton coupling to the thermal energy of matter fields produces a natural mechanism for gently relaxing the dilaton field into the correct minimum of the potential without fine-tuning of initial conditions the same mechanism is potentially relevant for stabilizing other moduli fields
